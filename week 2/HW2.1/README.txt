Our forward pass is working correctly, but unfortunately the backword pass caused some confusions, so we were not able to make it run properly in the end. In the coding support was stated that this can still be submitted as a regular submission.

The Provided sklearn link was not working, so we installed the module in our virtual environment.

Greetings Elena, Aaron and Jonas
